CMSC 447 HW 2 CRUD APP
Run the db.py first to make the user_database 
Then run app.py as then the thing should run
the app.run(0.0.0.0) was a fix as that allow for anyone to assess the app instead as without the 0.0.0.0 it would not run as it would be blocked.

This program is a standard CRUP app that created using squlite3 for the database and html for the frontend design that allows the user to interface with the database that is in the backend side.
By using squlite3 it allows for the user to be able to add data to the database that is then shown on the webpage.
This webpage allows for the user to see what data is already on the website and is update and cahnge the data if it's wrong or even delete if it's not needed.
